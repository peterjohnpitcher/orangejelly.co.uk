# Services Content

This directory contains markdown files for service descriptions, packages, and offerings.

## Structure
- Individual service files should be named with service slugs
- Service package files for bundled offerings
- Pricing and feature comparison data
- Images and icons for services should be referenced from `/public/images/services/`

Services should follow this frontmatter structure:

```markdown
