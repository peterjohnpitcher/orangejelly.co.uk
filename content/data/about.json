    "In March 2019, Billy and I took over The Anchor pub in Stanwell Moor. Like many licensees, we had no idea what we were walking into. Empty Monday nights, rising costs, endless admin, and the constant pressure to compete with chains.",
    "But here's what changed everything: I discovered how AI could handle the grunt work that was drowning us. Not sci-fi stuff - practical tools that gave us our time back and boosted our profits.",
    "Since then, we've transformed The Anchor from a struggling pub into a thriving community hub. Food GP jumped from 58% to 71%, quiz nights went from 20 to 25-35 regulars, and we saved ¬£250 per week on Sunday lunch waste alone.",
    "Orange Jelly exists to share these proven strategies with fellow licensees. No corporate nonsense, no jargon - just one licensee helping another with tools that actually work."
