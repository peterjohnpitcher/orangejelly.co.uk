      "question": "What if I can't afford help right now?",
      "answer": "I understand - cash flow is tight. That's why I charge hourly (¬£75) rather than huge upfront fees. Start with just 2-3 hours of help for quick wins. Most pubs make back their investment within the first weekend through increased sales."

      "question": "Do you work with all types of pubs?",

    {
      "question": "What makes you different from other consultants?",
      "answer": "I actually run a pub. Every strategy I recommend has been tested at The Anchor first. I'm not a consultant who's never pulled a pint - I'm dealing with the same challenges you are, every single day."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if your strategies don't work for my pub?",
      "answer": "That's why I stay closely involved during the first month. We review progress every week, adjust fast, and keep at it until the numbers move. These strategies transformed The Anchor and dozens of other pubs, and I'll stick with you to make sure they do the same for yours."
