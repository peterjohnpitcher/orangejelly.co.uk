    {
      "question": "How does the Empty Pub Recovery Package work?",
      "answer": "We start with a free consultation to understand your specific challenges. Then I create a custom 30-day action plan using strategies that worked at The Anchor. You get weekly check-ins, AI tools access, and my personal WhatsApp for questions. Most pubs see increased footfall within 2 weeks."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does your hourly consulting work?",
      "answer": "Simple - you only pay for the time you need. No packages, no minimum contracts. We agree on what needs doing, I track my time, and invoice you monthly. Most pubs need 15-25 hours for transformation, but you can start with just 2 hours."
    },
    {
      "question": "How quickly will I see more customers from the recovery package?",
      "answer": "Most pubs see improvements within 2 weeks. Social media campaigns start working immediately, events take 2-3 weeks to build momentum, and quiz nights typically fill up within 4-6 weeks. The Anchor went from 20 to 35 quiz regulars in 8 weeks."
    },
    {
      "question": "How can menu descriptions increase my food sales?",
      "answer": "Psychology-based descriptions trigger hunger and justify higher prices. 'Fish & chips' becomes 'Beer-battered Atlantic cod with triple-cooked chips and mushy peas'. Same dish, ¬£3 more, customers happier. Our food sales increased 40% with no recipe changes."
    },
    {
      "question": "What exactly do you do with menu AI?",
      "answer": "I use AI to analyze your menu, identify profit opportunities, and create mouth-watering descriptions. We'll optimize pricing, highlight high-margin items, and create seasonal variations. Takes 2 hours what used to take days, and sells better."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will AI-written menus sound fake or robotic?",
      "answer": "Not at all. I train the AI with your pub's personality and local dialect. The descriptions sound like you wrote them on your best day. Customers won't know it's AI - they'll just know they want to order everything."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you promote a pub quiz effectively?",
      "answer": "Multi-channel approach: AI-generated social posts 3x weekly, WhatsApp broadcasts to regulars, table talkers, and strategic partnerships with local businesses. We track what works and double down. Our quiz went from 20 to 35 regulars using this system."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the secret to quiz night success?",
      "answer": "Consistency, community, and clever marketing. Same night, same time, build traditions. Use AI for questions so you're not scrambling. Food deals that make sense (not giving away profit). Most importantly - make it an event, not just a quiz."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can AI really help with quiz nights?",
      "answer": "Absolutely. AI generates themed rounds in seconds, creates promotional content, analyzes which questions work best, and even suggests food pairings. I spend 30 minutes preparing what used to take 3 hours."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can AI really manage my pub's social media?",
      "answer": "AI doesn't manage it - you do, with AI doing the heavy lifting. I teach you to create a month's content in 2 hours, schedule it automatically, and track what works. You stay in control but save 20+ hours monthly."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will my social media posts look automated?",
      "answer": "No - they'll look better than before. AI helps create engaging content that sounds like you on your most creative day. Mix in real photos from your pub, and nobody knows the difference. We reach 70,000 people monthly this way."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if I'm not tech-savvy?",
      "answer": "Perfect - neither was I! If you can use WhatsApp, you can use these tools. I provide step-by-step videos, personal training, and ongoing support. Most clients are creating AI content within 2 hours of training."
    },
    {
      "question": "What kind of business insights can AI provide?",
      "answer": "AI reveals patterns humans miss: optimal pricing, quiet period opportunities, menu performance, staff scheduling efficiency, and customer behavior trends. We found ¬£75,000 of value hiding in our data - imagine what's in yours."
    },
    {
      "question": "How detailed are your AI business reports?",
      "answer": "As detailed as you want. From simple weekly dashboards to deep-dive analysis of every transaction. I'll teach you to generate reports that actually help make decisions, not just pretty graphs that mean nothing."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can AI help with supplier negotiations?",
      "answer": "Yes! AI analyzes your purchasing history, compares supplier prices, identifies over-ordering, and suggests negotiation points. We saved ¬£250/week on supplies using AI insights. Same quality, better prices."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you create pub events that actually work?",
      "answer": "Start with data - what does your community actually want? Use AI to analyze local trends, create compelling promotions, and track what works. Our gin tasting sells out because we know exactly what our customers want before they do."
    },
    {
      "question": "What makes your event planning different?",
      "answer": "I've run events that flopped and events that sold out in hours. I'll share both lessons. Plus, AI tools for promotion, booking management, and follow-up that turn one-time attendees into regulars. 85% of our tasting night guests come back."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can AI predict which events will be successful?",
      "answer": "AI analyzes local trends, competitor events, weather patterns, and your customer data to predict success. Not 100% accurate, but much better than guessing. We haven't had a failed event since using AI planning."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why don't you offer fixed-price packages?",
      "answer": "Every pub is different. You might need 5 hours of menu help or 30 hours of complete transformation. Hourly billing means you only pay for what you need, and can stop anytime. It's honest and fair."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I see examples of your work?",
      "answer": "Visit The Anchor any Tuesday for quiz night, check our social media @TheAnchorStanwell, or look at our food GP improvement from 58% to 71%. Better yet, WhatsApp me for a video walkthrough of everything."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you offer remote support?",
      "answer": "Yes! Most support is via video calls, screen sharing, and WhatsApp. I'm available 7 days a week. In-person visits available for Surrey pubs, but honestly, remote works just as well and saves you money."
