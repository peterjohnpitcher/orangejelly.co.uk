    {
      "question": "How much time will this take from my day?",
      "answer": "That's the whole point - to give you time back! Initial setup requires some collaboration (usually 2-3 calls), but once systems are in place, they run themselves. Our automation saves me 25+ hours per week at The Anchor."

      "question": "Can you help with specific challenges like empty Mondays or poor food sales?",
      "answer": "Absolutely. We create custom solutions for your specific challenges. Empty Mondays? We'll design events that work. Poor food sales? We'll optimize your menu and training. Every solution is tailored to your pub."
    },
    {
      "question": "How quickly will I see results?",
      "answer": "Most clients see improvements within 2-4 weeks. Social media automation shows results immediately, menu changes take 2-3 weeks to show in GP, and events usually fill up faster within the first month."
