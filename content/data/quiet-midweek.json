    },
    {
      "question": "How much promotion is needed?",
      "answer": "Week 1: Heavy push across all channels. Week 2-4: Moderate reminders. Month 2+: Events sell themselves through word-of-mouth. We spend 2 hours per week total on promotion now, and our events are packed."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if the first event flops?",
      "answer": "It might! Our first quiz had 8 people. But we learned, adjusted, and promoted better. Week 2 had 15. Week 3 had 22. Now we have 35 regulars. Persistence and refinement are key. Give any event 4 weeks before judging."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can this work in a small village pub?",
      "answer": "Absolutely. Small communities are desperate for midweek activities. You might need different events (craft night vs. cocktail masterclass), but the principle is the same: give people a reason to leave the house on a Tuesday."
    },
    {
      "question": "What about staff costs for quiet nights?",
      "answer": "That's the point - you're paying staff anyway! Better they serve 50 customers than stand around serving 5. Your fixed costs are covered. Every additional customer is almost pure profit. Busy staff are happy staff."
