    {
      "question": "Can small pubs really compete with chains?",
      "answer": "Not by playing their game. But absolutely yes by playing YOUR game. Chains compete on price and convenience. You compete on experience, community, and personality. Different game, different rules, and you have all the advantages in your game."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if there's a Wetherspoons right next door?",
      "answer": "Perfect! Let them have the price-sensitive customers while you build a community of people who value quality, atmosphere, and personal service. Our Wetherspoons is 200 yards away. We're not competing - we're offering something completely different."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long before I see results?",
      "answer": "First results within 7-14 days as regulars notice changes. Real momentum builds weeks 3-4. By day 60, you'll have carved out your niche and stopped the customer bleed to chains. Full transformation typically takes 90 days."
    },
    {
      "question": "Won't raising prices drive customers away?",
      "answer": "Only the wrong customers. When you position correctly and deliver unique value, the right customers happily pay more. We charge 40% more than Wetherspoons for similar items. Our customers don't care because they're not buying food - they're buying an experience."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if I've already tried everything?",
      "answer": "You've tried competing with chains on their terms. That never works. This is about completely changing the game. Not better prices or bigger portions - completely different value proposition that chains literally cannot copy even if they wanted to."
