# Live Music Events for Pubs: The Complete Guide to Booking, Hosting & Profiting

It's 9 PM on a Friday. The pub down the road has a queue around the corner for their live music night. Meanwhile, you're wondering if the expense and hassle of hosting bands is worth it when you could just stick Spotify on.

Here's what they know that you don't: Live music isn't just entertainment – it's transformation. Done right, it turns your pub from a place to drink into a destination, from a business into a community hub, from a quiet Friday into your busiest, most profitable night of the week.

But done wrong? It's expensive background noise that annoys regulars and empties your till.

Let's make sure you get it right.

## FAQs

### How do I deal with noise complaints?

Prevention is key. Meet neighbours before starting, invite them to events, have direct contact number, use sound limiters, finish on time.

### Should I pay bands in cash?

Get invoices for accounts. Cash is common but get signed receipts. Some acts are VAT registered. Keep clear records.

### What about original music vs covers?

Covers fill venues initially. Original music builds reputation. Ideal is 70/30 covers/originals for most pubs.

### How far in advance should I book?

Good acts book 2-3 months ahead. Build relationships for regular slots. Have backup contacts for cancellations.

### Do I need security?

Depends on crowd size/type. Often regular door staff sufficient. Large ticketed events may need SIA licensed security.

### What about band cancellations?

Always have Plan B. Build network of deps. Consider acoustic alternative. Communicate early and honestly with customers.
