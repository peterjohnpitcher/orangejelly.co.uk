"The village is dying, Peter. Twenty houses for sale, Post Office gone, bus service cut. We're next."

That was my neighbor, pint in hand, delivering what felt like a death sentence. Our village had shrunk from 1,200 to 800 people in five years. The arithmetic was brutal: fewer locals, less money, slow death.

Three years later, we're busier than when the village was thriving. Here's how we became a destination, not just a local.

## The Harsh Reality Check

- Population declining year on year

- Younger people moving to cities

- Remaining residents are older, drink less

- No passing trade

- Competition from supermarket alcohol

- Everyone knows everyone (gossip travels fast)

But here's what village pubs have that chains can never replicate: authenticity, stories, and the ability to become genuinely special.

## Become a Destination, Not a Default

The 20-Minute Rule
People will drive 20 minutes for something special. Your job: be special enough.

- "Traditional village pub" (there are thousands)

- "Friendly locals" (every pub claims this)

- "Good beer" (minimum expectation)

- "Home-cooked food" (so what?)

- "Best Sunday roast in the county" (specific, worth traveling for)

- "Monthly comedy nights with TV comedians" (unique in rural areas)

- "Only pub with Thai chef in 30 miles" (distinctive)

- "Dog menu and doggy play area" (targeting specific audience)

Find Your Thing
We tried everything until we found ours: Pie Night Wednesdays. Sounds simple? 
- 12 different pies, all homemade
- One celebrity guest pie monthly
- Pie of the Month club (subscription model)
- Now pulling people from 15 miles away
- Wednesday revenue up 380%

## The Multi-Purpose Model

Your pub can't just be a pub anymore. Become the village everything:

Morning: Village Office
- 8-11am: Coffee, pastries, newspapers
- Fast WiFi, quiet atmosphere
- Laptop-friendly tables
- Print/scan services (50p per page)
- Parcel drop-off point

Result: £40-60 daily revenue that didn't exist before

Afternoon: Community Hub
- Post Office counter (2-4pm twice weekly)
- Library book exchange
- Parish council meetings
- Prescription collection point
- Mobile hairdresser Thursdays

Each service brings different people in. They buy coffee, stay for lunch, book dinner.

Evening: Destination Dining
This is where you make real money:
- Thursday: Theme nights (Thai, tapas, tasting menus)
- Friday: Traditional pub classics done brilliantly
- Saturday: Date night menu
- Sunday: Famous roasts (book two weeks ahead)

## Food: Your Secret Weapon

Wet-led village pubs are dying. Food is survival. But not just any food:

The 80/20 Rule
- 80% solid pub classics done perfectly
- 20% signature dishes they can't get anywhere else

- The Anchor Burger (wagyu beef, secret sauce) - £18, food cost £5

- Grandma's Chicken Pie (actual grandma's recipe) - £14, food cost £3.50

- The Fisherman's Board (local suppliers) - £24, food cost £8

The Supply Chain Advantage
Village location = direct supplier relationships:
- Eggs from farm 200 yards away (sign on door: "Today's eggs walked here")
- Vegetables from three local growers
- Meat from village butcher
- Story with every dish

Marketing cost: zero. Premium charged: 20-30%.

## Build Your Visitor Economy

Tourism Partnerships
Every village has something:
- Historic church? Partner for funeral teas
- Nice walks? Become the walkers' pub
- Near National Trust? Do joint promotions
- Railway station? Market to day-trippers

- Designed five circular walks starting/ending at pub

- Created free walking maps

- Walker's lunch deal (soup, sandwich, drink: £12)

- Now get 30-40 walkers weekly

Events That Travel
Monthly events that pull from miles around:
- Comedy nights (split door with comedians)
- Wine tastings with local merchant
- Classic car meets (owners are big spenders)
- Craft fairs in car park
- Murder mystery dinners

Each event brings 40-60 people who wouldn't normally come.

## Digital Domination

The Facebook Strategy
Village Facebook groups are goldmines:
- Join every group within 10 miles
- Share daily specials
- Post kitchen prep videos
- Celebrate local achievements
- Never just advertise - provide value

Our posts reach 5,000 people weekly, zero advertising spend.

The Instagram Approach
Villages are photogenic. Use it:
- Morning mist over beer garden
- Seasonal changes
- Dogs of the day
- Behind-the-scenes stories
- Chef specials close-ups

Hashtag strategy: \#VillagePub \#\[CountyName\]Food \#CountryPub \#\[NearestTown\]

Google My Business Mastery
- Post weekly updates
- Answer every question
- Add photos constantly
- Correct all information
- Respond to all reviews

Result: Show up for "pub near me" within 10 miles

## The Community Balance

Don't Abandon Locals
Destination success means nothing if locals hate you:
- Keep one bar area "locals only" feel
- Maintain weekday lunch deals for pensioners
- Honor local traditions
- Give regulars input on changes
- Never price out your community

The Local Champions Program
Turn regulars into marketers:
- VIP cards for top 20 locals
- 10% discount always
- Preview new menus
- First booking on events
- Bring-a-friend bonuses

They become ambassadors, bringing visiting family and friends.

## Alternative Revenue Streams

The Shop Model
Sell what people need:
- Fresh bread (ordered day before)
- Milk and basics
- Ready meals (your food to take home)
- Local produce
- Gift hampers

Adds £200-300 weekly, minimal effort.

Room Rental
That unused upstairs room? Rent it:
- Yoga classes Tuesday mornings
- Book club monthly
- Business meetings
- Birthday parties
- Wake receptions

£500-1000 monthly extra income.

## The Three-Year Transformation

- Fix basics (cleaning, maintenance, service)

- Establish food reputation

- Build social media presence

- Start monthly events

- Develop signature offerings

- Build tourism partnerships

- Expand service hours

- Create subscription products

- Known as destination

- Booked weekends

- Multiple revenue streams

- Sustainable profits

## Your Village Pub Action Plan

- Audit what makes your village unique

- Join all local Facebook groups

- survey your regulars on what they want

- Launch one signature food item

- Start one monthly event

- Partner with one local business

- Establish morning coffee trade

- Build Instagram presence

- Create walking/cycling routes

- Review and double down on what works

- Cut what doesn't

- Plan year two expansion

The truth? Villages aren't dying - they're changing. Your pub can be the heartbeat that keeps yours alive. But you must evolve from "the local" to "the destination."

Start small. Be consistent. Give people reasons to drive past three other pubs to reach yours.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Won't becoming a destination alienate locals?

Only if done wrong. Keep your core local offers (pensioner lunches, regular's prices) while adding destination elements at different times. Locals actually love seeing their pub busy - it means it'll survive. Just ensure they always have their space and never feel priced out.

### How do I compete with town pubs that have more footfall?

You don't compete - you offer what they can't. Parking, gardens, peace, authenticity, personal service, local produce, community feel. Town pubs fight for random footfall. You build loyal customers who choose to visit.

### What if I can't afford big changes?

Start with what's free: clean thoroughly, rearrange furniture, improve service, use social media, partner with locals. One signature dish and monthly event can transform your reputation. Build gradually - reinvest profits into next improvement.

### Should I focus on food or stay wet-led?

Unless you have unique circumstances, food is essential for village pub survival. But start small - three dishes done brilliantly beats twenty done average. Build reputation gradually. Even simple soup and sandwiches beat nothing.
