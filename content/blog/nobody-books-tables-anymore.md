"We're fully booked," I said to the couple at the door. The pub was half empty. They looked confused, frustrated, and left. Twenty minutes later, three bookings no-showed. We served twelve covers in a sixty-seat pub on a Saturday night.

Sound familiar? Here's how we fixed our booking chaos and increased covers by 40% without any expensive booking systems.

## The Booking Paradox

- Take bookings = risk no-shows and empty tables

- Don't take bookings = risk turning away guaranteed money

- Too many bookings = no atmosphere, angry walk-ins

- Too few bookings = anxious about covers

The solution isn't choosing one or the other - it's mastering both.

## The Golden Ratio

After testing every combination, here's what works:

The 60/40 Rule
- 60% bookable tables
- 40% walk-in only
- Adjust by day (Tuesday 80/20, Saturday 50/50)
- Never book 100% (kills atmosphere)

Time Slot Strategy
Instead of "table all evening," use slots:
- 12:00-2:00pm (lunch)
- 5:30-7:30pm (early dinner)
- 7:45-9:45pm (main dinner)
- 10:00pm+ (late drinks/snacks)

Result: Triple your capacity without more tables

## The No-Show Solution

The Confirmation System
Booking taken → Confirmation text same day → Reminder 24hrs before → Final check 2hrs before

Template: "Hi \[Name\], looking forward to seeing you tomorrow at 7:30pm for 4 people. Reply YES to confirm or call to change. The Anchor"

Result: 90% response rate, 50% reduction in no-shows

The Deposit Debate
When to take deposits:
- Groups of 8+ (always)
- Saturday nights (December only)
- Special events (always)
- Regular dinner (never)

How much: £10 per person, goes off final bill
Method: Card details held, only charged for no-shows

The Blacklist Reality
Three strikes system:
1. First no-show: noted
2. Second no-show: warning
3. Third no-show: deposits required

We track in a simple spreadsheet. Repeat offenders know they're on notice.

## Walk-In Management

The Welcome Script
"Hi! Table for two? We're pretty busy but should have something in about 15 minutes. Can I get you a drink at the bar while you wait?"

Never: "We're fully booked"
Always: "Let me see what we can do"

The Wait List That Works
Not a clipboard - use a small notebook:
- Name and mobile number
- Party size
- Time arrived
- Quoted wait time

Text when ready: "Hi \[Name\], your table's ready at The Anchor! See you in 5 mins or we'll need to release it."

The Bar-to-Table Pipeline
Waiting customers are goldmines:
- Average bar spend while waiting: £15
- Conversion to dining: 80%
- Likelihood to book next time: 90%
- Reviews mentioning great service: 60%

Make waiting pleasant = profitable queue

## Technology Without Losing Soul

The Booking Platforms Trap
OpenTable, Resy, etc. promise earth, deliver complications:
- Commission fees (£1-3 per cover)
- Lose customer relationship
- Can't control experience
- Generic confirmation emails

Better: Simple system that works

Our £0 Tech Stack
- Google Forms for online bookings
- Auto-sends to pub Gmail
- Staff transfer to paper diary
- WhatsApp for confirmations
- Total cost: nothing

Fancy? No. Effective? Absolutely.

The Diary System
Still use a physical diary because:
- No tech failures
- Everyone can use it
- Visual layout works
- Flexible for changes
- Backup in photos

- Pencil only (things change)

- Include phone numbers

- Note dietary requirements

- Mark special occasions

- Color code (red = confirmed, blue = tentative)

## Day-by-Day Strategy

Monday-Tuesday: Flexible
- 80% walk-ins
- Book only for groups 6+
- Focus on spontaneous trade

Wednesday-Thursday: Structured
- 70% bookings
- Target food-focused customers
- Push online booking

Friday-Saturday: Balanced
- 50/50 split
- Two sittings system
- Deposits for large groups

Sunday: Traditional
- 90% bookings for lunch
- Walk-ins for evening
- Family-friendly timing

## Special Events Management

The Pre-Book Strategy
Big matches, holidays, local events:
- Open bookings 4 weeks prior
- Deposits for all bookings
- Clear timing expectations
- Limited menu (faster turnover)

The Ticket System
For very special events:
- Sell tickets not tables
- Include first drink
- Fixed menu
- No refunds policy

Works for: Comedy nights, wine tastings, holiday dinners

## Staff Training Essentials

The Phone Manner
Script for taking bookings:
"The Anchor, \[Name\] speaking... Lovely! Let me check availability for \[repeat details\]... Perfect, I have a nice table for you. Can I take a contact number?"

- Repeat details back

- Get phone number

- Mention any policies

- Sound genuinely pleased

The Floor Management
Every staff member knows:
- Current availability
- Expected wait times
- How to quote accurately
- When to involve manager

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

Overbooking "Just in Case"
Disaster waiting to happen:
- Stressed staff
- Angry customers
- Terrible reviews
- Lost regulars

Better: Book to 80% capacity, walk-ins fill gaps

Holding Tables Too Long
15-minute rule:
- Hold for 15 minutes maximum
- Then release to walk-ins
- Text late party: "Table released, still welcome for next available"

Different Rules for Regulars
Dangerous game:
- Other customers notice
- Staff get confused
- Creates resentment
- Loses more than gains

Better: Same rules, better service

## Metrics That Matter

- Total covers

- No-show rate

- Walk-in conversion

- Average wait time

- Table turnover rate

- Covers up 40%

- No-shows down 60%

- Walk-in satisfaction up 80%

- Revenue up 35%

## The Seasonal Adjustment

Summer Strategy
- More walk-ins (60%)
- Garden stays flexible
- Bookings for inside only

Winter Approach
- More bookings (70%)
- Cozy inside guaranteed
- Deposits protect revenue

December Madness
- 90% pre-booked

The truth? Modern diners want both flexibility and certainty. Give them options, manage expectations, and never let a table sit empty because of rigid rules.

Remember: Every empty chair is money lost, but every overcrowded service is reputation damaged. Find your balance.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Should I use an online booking system?

Start simple with Google Forms or even just email. Expensive booking platforms eat into margins and lose personal touch. Only upgrade when you're consistently full and need automation. Most pubs never need expensive systems.

### How do I handle regular customers who just show up?

Always keep some tables for walk-ins, even on busy nights. Regulars are your bread and butter. If truly full, personally manage their wait, buy them a drink, and ensure they get the next table. They'll understand if handled well.

### What about people who book multiple restaurants?

This is why confirmations matter. Text confirmation catches double-bookers. For repeat offenders, require deposits. Most importantly, build relationships so people choose you over their backup options.

### Should I charge for no-shows?

Only for groups of 8+ or special events. Small table no-show charges create more problems than they solve. Better to track repeat offenders and require deposits from them specifically. Focus on prevention, not punishment.
