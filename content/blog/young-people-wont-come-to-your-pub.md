Remember when pubs were the default social hub for young people? Those days might seem long gone, but here's the truth: young people still want what pubs offer - community, experiences, and somewhere that isn't their flat. They just need a reason to choose you over Netflix.

## The Real Problem (It's Not What You Think)

Young people aren't avoiding pubs - they're avoiding boring pubs. They've got unlimited entertainment in their pocket, Deliveroo at their fingertips, and a cost-of-living crisis hitting them harder than any generation before. Your warm beer and sticky carpets aren't competing with other pubs anymore - you're competing with everything.

But here's the encouraging bit: when you give them a genuine reason to come, they become your most loyal, vocal advocates. They'll Instagram every visit, bring their entire friend group, and turn your quiet Tuesday into their weekly tradition.

## Create Instagram-Worthy Moments (Without Being Cringe)

The Golden Hour Setup
Between 5-7pm, your pub should photograph like a dream. It's not about renovating - it's about understanding light:
- String up warm fairy lights (£30 from B&Q)
- Create one stunning corner with plants and vintage mirrors
- Keep your glassware spotless - it photographs better
- Serve drinks that look as good as they taste

Young customers take 5-10 photos per visit. Make sure they've got something worth sharing.

The Signature Serve
Create one drink that's uniquely yours:
- Our "Anchor Sunset" (gin, elderflower, and edible flowers) gets posted 20+ times a week
- Cost: £1.20 to make, sells for £8.50
- The flower costs 10p but drives £170 weekly revenue

## Events They Actually Want

Forget What You Think They Want
❌ Generic quiz nights
❌ Cheesy themed parties  
❌ "Student nights" with cheap shots
❌ DJ playing music from 2010

What Actually Works
✅ **Bottomless Brunch Done Right** - Not just prosecco, but craft cocktails, decent food, 90 minutes, £35
✅ **Board Game Cafés** - Partner with local board game groups, Sunday afternoons, coffee focus
✅ **Small Plate Sundays** - Tapas-style sharing, encourages groups, lower price point
✅ **Work From Pub Days** - Fast WiFi, coffee, lunch deals, quiet background music till 5pm

## The Non-Alcoholic Revolution

This isn't about designated drivers anymore. 30% of under-30s are reducing alcohol consumption. If your non-alcoholic offering is J2O and Coke, you're already losing.

Build a Proper Zero-Proof Menu
- Stock at least 5 craft alcohol-free beers
- Create 3-4 mocktails with the same care as cocktails
- Price them fairly (£4-6, not £2)
- Train staff to recommend them without judgment

We introduced this and saw Tuesday night revenue jump 40% - mostly from groups where 2-3 people weren't drinking.

## Build a Vibe, Not a Venue

Music Matters More Than You Think
- Spotify playlist isn't enough - curate properly
- Volume that allows conversation
- Change the vibe throughout the day
- Let regulars add songs to a collaborative playlist

The Phone Charging Station
Sounds small, but it's huge:
- Install USB charging points at 3-4 tables (£200 total)
- Becomes THE place to meet after work
- Groups stay longer when phones are charging
- Instagram stories: "This pub has chargers!"

## Staff Are Everything

- Train them to remember names and drinks

- Give them input on events and drinks

- Let them manage the Instagram (with guidelines)

- Pay them properly - good staff are marketing

## The Community Approach

Partner With Purpose
- Local gym: post-workout protein smoothies and healthy options
- University/college: study spaces during the day
- Start-up hubs: networking events, working lunches
- Gaming cafés: tournament viewing parties

Be the Local Living Room
Create reasons to visit that aren't about drinking:
- Monday: Co-working day with great coffee
- Tuesday: Board games and small plates
- Wednesday: Life drawing or creative workshops
- Thursday: Traditional pub feel returns
- Weekend: Full energy, events, music

## Digital Presence That Doesn't Try Too Hard

Instagram Strategy
- Post stories daily, grid 2-3 times weekly
- User-generated content is gold - repost everything
- Behind-the-scenes content performs best
- Respond to every comment and message

The WhatsApp Groups
Create groups for different crowds:
- "Tuesday Regulars" - 30 people who never miss board game night
- "Brunch Club" - weekend warriors
- "Pub Workers" - your weekday laptop crowd

Send one message weekly with what's on. That's it.

## Price It Right

- £8.50 cocktails that are worth posting about

- £5 pints that are perfectly served

- £12-15 main courses that fill them up

- £25-35 experience packages

They'll pay for quality and experience. They won't pay for average.

## Start Small, Test Everything

Week 1: Improve your coffee offering and WiFi
Week 2: Create one Instagram-worthy cocktail
Week 3: Launch one weekly event
Week 4: Measure, adjust, repeat

## The Results You Can Expect

- 25-30% increase in under-30s customers

- 40% boost in Tuesday-Thursday revenue

- 200+ new Instagram followers

- 15-20 new regulars who bring friends

## Your Action Plan

Today:
1. Audit your current offering honestly - would you choose your pub?
2. Pick ONE thing to improve this week
3. Ask three people under 30 what would make them visit more

This Week:
1. Fix your WiFi and add phone chargers
2. Create one signature serve
3. Plan one new event for next month

This Month:
1. Launch your first young-person focused event
2. Build your Instagram presence properly
3. Train staff on the new approach

The truth? Young people are desperate for real-world connection. They're tired of dating apps, Zoom calls, and social media. Your pub can be their answer - but only if you give them a reason to look up from their phones.

Start with one change. Make it brilliant. Build from there.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Won't I alienate my older regulars?

Not if you do it right. Keep traditional pub elements during peak times for regulars. Use quieter periods for younger-focused events. Our 60+ regulars actually love the Tuesday board game crowd - they've adopted them!

### How do I stop it becoming a rowdy student bar?

Focus on experiences and quality, not cheap drinks. Attract the coffee-and-cocktails crowd, not the shots-and-fights crowd. Price point and atmosphere are your filters - aim for young professionals and creatives, not just anyone under 30.

### What if I can't afford renovations?

You don't need them. Clean thoroughly, add £30 of fairy lights, rearrange furniture to create zones, and focus on service. Young people value authenticity over aesthetics. A genuinely welcoming traditional pub beats a try-hard trendy bar every time.

### Should I get on TikTok?

Only if you can do it authentically. Instagram and WhatsApp groups are more important for pubs. If you do TikTok, let young staff run it, post behind-the-scenes content, and don't try to go viral - build community instead.
