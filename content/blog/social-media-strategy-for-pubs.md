# The Complete Social Media Strategy Guide for Pubs in 2024

Your competitor down the street just posted a blurry photo of fish and chips with the caption "Food available." It got 3 likes – two from staff and one from his mum. Meanwhile, The Crafty Fox across town turned a simple quiz night announcement into 200 shares and a fully booked Tuesday. The difference? A proper social media strategy.

Social media isn't just about posting photos anymore. It's your most powerful tool for filling tables, building community, and competing with chains that have marketing budgets bigger than your annual turnover. This guide shows you exactly how to use it effectively.

## Why Social Media Matters More Than Ever for Pubs

The numbers tell the story:

- 78% of people check a pub's social media before first visiting

- 64% make dining decisions based on Instagram posts

- Pubs with active social media see 23% more foot traffic

But here's what the statistics don't capture: social media levels the playing field. While Wetherspoons spends millions on TV ads, you can reach the same local audience for free with the right strategy.

## The Foundation: Understanding Your Social Media Audience

Before posting anything, understand who you're talking to:

### Your Core Pub Audiences on Social Media:

**The Locals (25-55)**

- Check Facebook daily for community news

- Share posts about local businesses

- Value familiarity and tradition

- Respond to personal touches

**The Foodies (25-40)**

- Instagram-first decision makers

- Seek unique experiences to share

- Influenced by visual presentation

- Will travel for the 'gram

**The Event Seekers (21-35)**

- Use social media to plan nights out

- Share experiences in real-time

- Respond to FOMO marketing

- Bring groups when engaged

**The Sunday Crowd (35-65)**

- Plan family gatherings via Facebook

- Share recommendations in local groups

- Book based on photos of roasts

- Value family-friendly messaging

## Platform-Specific Strategies That Work

### Facebook: Your Community Hub

Facebook remains king for pub marketing, especially for reaching locals and families.

**What Works on Facebook:**

- Live videos during events (300% more engagement)

- Local community involvement posts

- Behind-the-scenes content

- Event creation and promotion

- Menu updates and specials

- Customer testimonials and reviews

**Facebook Best Practices:**

1. Post 4-5 times per week

1. Use Facebook Events for everything

1. Respond to comments within 2 hours

1. Share in local community groups

1. Go live during peak events

1. Use location tags religiously

**Example That Works:**

a typical traditional pub in Camden posts a "Meet the Team Monday" every week, featuring a staff member's story and their favourite menu item. Engagement increased 450% and Monday footfall up 35%.

### Instagram: Your Visual Showcase

Instagram sells the experience before customers walk through the door.

**What Works on Instagram:**

- High-quality food photography

- Stories for daily specials

- Reels for events and atmosphere

- User-generated content reposts

- Behind-the-scenes content

- Cocktail-making videos

**Instagram Best Practices:**

1. Post to feed 3-4 times per week

1. Use Stories daily

1. Create 2-3 Reels weekly

1. Use 10-15 relevant hashtags

1. Respond to DMs as reservations

**Content That Converts:**

The Botanist in Manchester grew from 2K to 15K followers by posting 15-second Reels of cocktails being made. Table bookings increased 40% with customers asking for "the drinks from Instagram."

### TikTok: The Growth Engine

Ignore TikTok at your peril – it's not just for teenagers anymore.

**What Works on TikTok:**

1. Show personality over polish

1. Collaborate with local creators

**Industry Example:**

a typical riverside pub in Brighton went viral with a "rating customer chat-up lines" series. One video hit 2M views, resulting in queue around the block for three weeks.

### Twitter/X: Real-Time Engagement

Perfect for announcements and banter with locals.

**What Works on Twitter:**

- Live sports commentary

- Quick updates and announcements

- Witty responses to customers

- Local news engagement

1. Build a photo library

## Engagement Tactics That Build Community

### The Response Rule:

- Reply to comments within 2 hours

- Address complaints publicly, resolve privately

- Thank every compliment

- Encourage user-generated content

- Share customer posts

- Create conversation, not broadcasts

### Community Building Strategies:

**Create Exclusive Groups:**

The Queen's Head created a "Queen's VIP" Facebook group for regulars. Members get first dibs on event tickets and special offers. Result: 85% increase at The Anchor in midweek visits from group members.

**User-Generated Content Campaigns:**

The Anchor runs monthly photo contests with themes like "Best Pub Dog" or "Messiest Wings Eater." Winners get bar tabs, pub gets free content.

**Local Influencer Partnerships:**

Partner with micro-influencers (1K-10K followers) in your area. Offer them a unique experience in exchange for posts. More effective and affordable than paid ads.

## Measuring Success: Metrics That Matter

### Vanity Metrics vs Value Metrics:

**Vanity Metrics (less important):**

- Follower count

- Likes on posts

- Generic comments

**Value Metrics (focus on these):**

- Foot traffic from social

- Reservations via social

- Event attendance

- Share rate

- Saves on Instagram

- Click-through to website

- Direct messages

- Tags and mentions

### Tracking Tools:

- Facebook/Instagram Insights

- Google Analytics for website traffic

- Reservation system source tracking

- Simple "How did you hear about us?" at point of sale

- QR codes for specific campaigns

## Advanced Strategies for Growth

### a typical neighborhood pub SEO Connection:

- Consistent NAP (Name, Address, Phone) across platforms

- Regular Google My Business posts

- Encourage check-ins and reviews

- Respond to all reviews

- Use location tags religiously

- Create location-specific content

### Paid Social That Works:

When organic reach isn't enough, smart paid promotion can multiply results:

**Facebook/Instagram Ads That Convert:**

- Boost event posts to local radius

- Retarget website visitors

- Create lookalike audiences from customer emails

- Promote special offers to competitors' followers

- Use video ads for better engagement

**Budget Guide:**

- Start with £5-10 per day

- Test different audiences

- Focus on 3-mile radius

- Promote midweek offers

- Track cost per reservation

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### The "Set and Forget" Syndrome:

Creating profiles then abandoning them is worse than having no social media. Inactive accounts suggest an inactive pub.

### Over-Promotion:

Follow the 80/20 rule: 80% valuable/entertaining content, 20% promotional. Nobody follows accounts that only sell.

### Ignoring Negative Feedback:

Address complaints quickly and professionally. Future customers judge you on how you handle problems, not whether you have them.

### Buying Followers:

Fake followers kill engagement rates and damage credibility. 100 real local followers beat 10,000 bots.

### Inconsistent Branding:

Use the same profile pictures, colours, and voice across platforms. Confusion kills trust.

## Your Social Media Success Starts Now

Start small, be consistent, and remember: perfect is the enemy of good. That slightly shaky video of your chef explaining tonight's special will outperform a polished stock photo every time.

Your community is already on social media, talking about where to go tonight. Make sure they're talking about you.
