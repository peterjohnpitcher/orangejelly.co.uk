# Premium Tasting Nights - The Anchor

## The Problem

We needed events that would bring in new customers and create regulars. Generic events weren't working, and we didn't have the expertise to run sophisticated tasting evenings. How could we create premium events that justified £35 tickets while ensuring people would come back?

## The Solution

Created a quarterly series: gin, rum, tequila, and winter warmers tastings. Partnered with Greene King to connect with premium brands. £35 includes all spirits, mixers, and themed meal. Limited to 25 tickets (private room capacity). Added educational elements and mini-quiz with prizes. Used AI for sophisticated marketing and follow-up campaigns.

## Results

- **Retention Rate**: 85% (become regulars)
- **Ticket Sales**: Near sellout (every event)
- **Revenue per Event**: £875 (plus bar sales)
- **New Customer %**: 40% (expanding reach)

## Time Investment

6 hours per event including promotion
