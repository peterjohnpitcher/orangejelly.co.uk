# Sunday Lunch Pre-order System - The Anchor

## The Problem

We were losing approximately £250 per week on Sunday lunch waste - thrown away protein, vegetables, plus wasted labour and energy costs preparing food that didn't sell. The previous tenants had set prices so low they weren't profitable, creating unrealistic customer expectations. We needed to eliminate waste while managing the value perception.

## The Solution

Implemented a custom-built pre-order system requiring £5 per person deposits through PayPal. Everything is now prepared fresh to order. Used AI to analyze booking patterns and optimize purchasing. Built a back-office management system for bookings, customer details, and invoicing. Clear communication about why pre-orders ensure freshness and reduce waste.

## Results

- **Weekly Waste**: £0 (down from £250)
- **Food Quality**: Everything fresh (vs batch cooked)
- **Profit Margin**: Now profitable (was loss-making)
- **No-show Rate**: Near zero (deposits ensure commitment)

## Time Investment

10 hours initial setup + 1 hour weekly management
