# Quiz Night Transformation - The Anchor

## The Problem

Our Tuesday nights were deadly quiet. When QuestionOne was running our quizzes, they ran into the ground - sometimes we wouldn't even get one team turn up, yet we were stuck paying their bill. The quiz format was stale, promotion was minimal, and Tuesday had become our worst night of the week.

## The Solution

We took over the quiz ourselves and completely renovated the concept using AI. Created engaging weekly themes, automated social media campaigns that started a week in advance, built WhatsApp groups for regulars, and used AI to generate fresh, locally-relevant questions. Moved to 7pm Wednesday (once monthly) to avoid clashing with other venues.

## Results

- **Regular Attendance**: 25-35 people (up from 0-5)
- **Average Spend**: £25 per person (+67%)
- **Entry Fee Revenue**: £75-105 per night (from £0)
- **Tuesday Performance**: 3rd busiest night (was quietest)

## Time Investment
