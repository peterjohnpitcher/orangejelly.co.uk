# Social Media Automation - The Anchor

## The Problem

Social media was eating up hours each week with minimal results. Posts were sporadic, inconsistent, and reached hardly anyone. We'd spend ages crafting a single post, only to get a handful of likes. Meanwhile, competitors seemed to be everywhere online while we were invisible.

## The Solution

Developed custom AI prompts to generate social media content in bulk - creating a month's worth of posts in one session. Posts across Facebook, Instagram, and Google My Business daily. AI ensures posts don't clash and maintains consistent voice. Focus on local engagement, event promotion, and community building rather than sales.

## Results

- **Monthly Views**: 60,000-70,000 (from under 1,000)
- **Time Investment**: 2 hours/week (down from 10+)
- **Posting Frequency**: Daily (from sporadic)
- **Event Attendance**: Consistently full (social drives bookings)

## Time Investment

2 hours weekly for all platforms
