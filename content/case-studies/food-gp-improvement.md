# Food GP Improvement - The Anchor

## The Problem

When we took over, the previous tenants were buying food from supermarkets, resulting in incredibly low GP. The menu was outdated, descriptions were boring, and pricing made no sense. Customers weren't ordering high-margin items, and food was more of a loss-leader than profit center.

## The Solution

Partnered with commercial suppliers (Barrel And Stone, Brakes, Bidfood) for consistency and better margins. Used AI to analyze menu psychology and rewrite descriptions using sensory language. Implemented strategic pricing and menu positioning. Introduced stone-baked pizzas as a high-margin hero product. Regular AI-powered menu updates based on seasonal ingredients and costs.

## Results

- **Food GP**: 71% (up from 58%)
- **Average Spend**: Increased Â£4.50 (+31%)
- **Pizza Sales**: Top seller (highest margin item)
- **Customer Satisfaction**: Higher (better quality, consistency)

## Time Investment

8 hours initial setup + 2 hours monthly updates
