## What makes Orange Jelly different from other pub marketing agencies?

We actually run a pub - The Anchor in Stanwell Moor. Every strategy we recommend has been tested in our own business first. We're not an agency; I'm a licensee who understands your challenges because I face them too. Plus I still work full-time, so I know about juggling everything.

## What advantages do independent pubs have over chains?

Personal service, flexibility, local knowledge, unique atmosphere, better quality, community connection, and the ability to adapt quickly. Chains are slow corporate machines - you can outmaneuver them every time.

We hear this a lot. The difference is we're licensees who've solved this exact problem. Our strategies aren't theories - they're proven methods that transformed The Anchor's quiet nights into profitable evenings.

## Can a small pub really compete with big chains?

Absolutely. David beats Goliath when he's smart. At The Anchor, we compete successfully with nearby chains. The key is playing to your strengths, not trying to beat them at their game.

## Can I really market my pub without spending money?

Absolutely. The best pub marketing is often free - word of mouth, social media, community partnerships, and email marketing cost nothing but time. We filled The Anchor using mostly free strategies before investing in paid advertising.

## Why is my pub so quiet Monday to Thursday?

Most pubs rely on weekend trade and hope midweek 'sorts itself out'. It won't. Quiet weeknights need specific strategies: targeted offers, the right events, and messaging that gives people a reason to leave the house on a Tuesday.

## Do you really understand what I'm going through?

Absolutely. The Anchor was in terrible physical state when we took over in March 2019 - leaking roof, no insulation, paper rotas. We've dealt with everything: staff walking out mid-shift, supplier nightmares, fierce competition. That's why Orange Jelly exists - to help you avoid our mistakes.

## How is Orange Jelly different from other consultants?

I'm not a consultant - I'm a licensee who runs a pub every day. No suits, no PowerPoints, no corporate jargon. Just practical help from someone who understands because I'm dealing with the same challenges. Plus, we use AI to save time on the boring bits.

## Will this work for my type of pub?

Yes. We've helped gastropubs, community locals, sports bars, and country inns. The principles work because they're based on human psychology and proven hospitality strategies, not gimmicks.

## Can I see examples of your work?

Visit The Anchor! See our menus, watch our social media in action, attend a quiz night. Everything I teach, we use daily. First pint's on me - seeing is believing.
