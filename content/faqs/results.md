We've improved food GP from 58% to 71%, grown quiz nights to 25-35 regulars, achieve 60,000-70,000 social media views monthly, and added £75,000-£100,000 of value to our business using AI.

Results vary by pub, but at The Anchor we've seen quiz nights grow from 20 to 25-35 regulars, tasting nights with 85% retention, and 60,000-70,000 social media views monthly. Most improvements show within 30 days.

## How quickly can I see results for my empty pub?

Most pubs see 25-40% increase in covers within 30 days. Our proven system starts working immediately - you'll notice more bookings in week one, busier nights by week two, and significantly fuller tables by day 30.

## How long until free marketing shows results?

## How quickly will I see midweek improvements?

Most pubs see 30-50% increase in midweek covers within 2 weeks. By week 4, you should be at 60-70% capacity on previously dead nights. The Anchor went from 20 to 85 people for Tuesday quiz in 6 weeks.

## What if your solutions don't work for my pub?

Every pub is different, which is why we offer a 30-day money-back guarantee. If you don't see improved results within 30 days, you get a full refund. But honestly, the strategies work because they're based on real pub experience, not theory.

## How can menu descriptions increase my food sales?

Psychology-based menu descriptions guide customers to order more profitable dishes and increase average spend by £7 per table. We use proven techniques like sensory language, storytelling, and strategic positioning that have increased food GP by up to 15% for our clients.

## Can AI help with supplier negotiations?

Yes! AI analyzes your purchasing patterns, compares supplier prices, and identifies savings opportunities. I've saved £250/week on food waste alone by optimizing our ordering based on AI predictions.

## Can AI predict which events will be successful?

Yes! By analyzing local demographics, past event performance, and social media engagement, AI helps predict which events will draw crowds. It's helped us avoid costly flops and double down on winners.

## How quickly will I see results?

At The Anchor, our first AI-powered quiz night brought in 35 people instead of the usual 20 - that was week one. Most pubs see their first wins within 14 days because I focus on quick-impact strategies first. You won't wait months wondering if it's working.
