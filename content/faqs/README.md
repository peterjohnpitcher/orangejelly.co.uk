# FAQs Content

This directory contains markdown files for frequently asked questions organized by topic or service area.

## Structure
- FAQ files should be organized by category (e.g., `general.md`, `services.md`, `pricing.md`)
- Each file contains related FAQs for easier management and faster loading
- Cross-references between FAQ categories should use relative links

## File Format
FAQ files should follow this frontmatter structure:

```markdown
