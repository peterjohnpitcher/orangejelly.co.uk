# Process FAQs

## Do I need to spend money on advertising?

No. Our system focuses on organic growth through better messaging, community engagement, and word-of-mouth. Optional paid ads can accelerate results, but they're not required.

## How quickly can you help my struggling pub?

I typically respond within 2 hours during the day. We can have an initial chat about your problems today, and I'll often send you 2-3 quick wins you can implement immediately - no charge. Full support packages can start within days.

## I'm not tech-savvy. Will I be able to use these AI tools?

If you can send a WhatsApp message, you can use these tools. I explain everything in plain English - no jargon, no confusion. When I show you how to create a month of social posts in 20 minutes, you'll wonder why everyone makes it sound so complicated.

## Do I need to be good at social media?

No. Authentic posts outperform polished content for pubs. Phone photos, genuine updates, and community focus work better than professional content. We'll show you simple formulas anyone can follow.

## What if I don't have time for marketing?

15 minutes daily is enough with the right systems. Batch content creation, automation tools, and simple templates mean you can market effectively in less time than counting the till. We'll set up systems that run themselves.

## When are you available?

I work around pub life. Early mornings before deliveries, quiet afternoons, or late evenings after service. I know when you're free because I live the same schedule.

## What if I'm not tech-savvy?

Perfect - neither was I! If you can send a WhatsApp message, you can use these AI tools. I provide step-by-step training designed for busy licensees, not tech experts. Most clients are posting confidently within days.

## Do you offer remote support?

Yes! Most AI training works perfectly over video calls. I support pubs across the UK with screen sharing, recorded tutorials, and WhatsApp support. Distance is no barrier to getting help.

## How do we get started?

WhatsApp me. Tell me your biggest problem. I'll tell you exactly how I fixed the same issue at The Anchor and how long it'll take for your pub. No sales pitch, no pressure - just licensee to licensee.
