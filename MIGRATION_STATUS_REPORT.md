### Rollback Plan (Issue #43)
**Status: ‚ö†Ô∏è Should Do First**

- Sanity data not exported
- No documentation of current config

## Critical Path Forward

### Phase 1: Preparation (Do First)
1. **Issue #43**: Create rollback plan and backup
2. Export all Sanity data to JSON files
3. Create pre-migration branch

### Phase 2: Blog Migration
1. **Issue #27**: Import blogs to Storyblok
2. **Issue #28**: Update blog pages to use Storyblok

### Phase 3: Static Content Migration
1. **Issues #29-33**: Migrate all static pages to hardcoded
2. **Issues #34-35**: Migrate shared components

### Phase 4: Cleanup
1. **Issue #36**: Remove Sanity infrastructure
2. **Issues #37-38**: Remove Sanity code
3. **Issue #40**: Update documentation

### Phase 5: Validation
1. **Issue #39**: Test everything works
2. **Issue #41**: Verify no Sanity remains
3. **Issue #42**: Validate no content lost

## Recommendations

1. **Start with Issue #43** - Create backup before any changes
2. **Test in staging branch** - Don't migrate directly on main
3. **Migrate incrementally** - One page type at a time
4. **Keep Sanity running** - Until fully migrated and tested
5. **Document as you go** - Track what's been migrated

## Files Requiring Updates

### High Priority (50+ files)
- All page components in src/app/
- All wrapper components
- All lib/sanity-*.ts files
- package.json and lock file
- .env.local and .env.example

### Directories to Remove
- /sanity-studio (entire folder)
- /src/lib/sanity-*.ts files
- Migration scripts once complete

## Effort Estimate

Based on the scope:
- **Total Effort**: 3-5 days of focused work
- **Blog Migration**: 1 day
- **Static Pages**: 1-2 days
- **Cleanup & Testing**: 1-2 days
- **Risk Level**: Medium (with proper backup)

## Conclusion

The migration has not started. All infrastructure, code, and dependencies for Sanity remain fully integrated. The Storyblok setup is prepared but not active. A systematic approach following the critical path above is recommended to complete the migration safely.
