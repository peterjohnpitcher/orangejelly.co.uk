# Orange Jelly Website Claims Audit

## Overview
This document provides a comprehensive audit of all claims made on the Orange Jelly website as of August 2025. Claims are organized by category for easy review and updating.

## 1. Time-Saving Claims

### Primary Claims
- **"25 hours of value per week"** - Current main claim about AI value addition
- **"Save At Least 5 Hours a Week"** - Footer/tagline claim
    Change this to save at least 15 hours a week
- **"120-150 hours equivalent work per week in spare time"** - Proposed update
    Adjust this to 120-150 hours equivalent work per week by using AI to get great work done faster

### Specific Time Claims
- **2 hours per week** on social media (down from previous time)
    If this is for Social only, it needst o be 10 hours a week.
- **2 hours earlier home** every night (Billy's testimonial)
    No, the pub's still busy, AI just means that we can get great work done faster.
- **Response within 2-4 hours** during pub hours
    Change it to 'I'll always respond as quickly as I can, but bear with me'.
- **10 minutes of advice** welcome (quick questions)
    Always happy to talk to someone on the phone, no charges, no restrictions. I understand that sometimes people just have questions and want to talk.
- **Various training durations**: 2, 4, or 8 hours
    They're all fair, just make sure prices are always consistent at £75 per hour plus VAT.

### Blog Time Investment Claims
Multiple specific time investments listed in blog posts:
- 30 minutes/week for user-generated content
- 15 minutes/day for Google review replies
- 10 minutes/day for behind-the-scenes content
- 1 hour/week for chalk signs
- 2 hours/month for guerrilla marketing

All seem fair without me seeing the context, where is the content being used?

## 2. Timeline & Results Claims

### Core Timeline Promises
- **"Results in 14 Days"** - Major trust badge across site
    Can we make this 28 days and caveat it that you also have to trust the process.
- **"Within 30 days"** - Most common timeline for results/ROI
    I prefer this to a 14 day claim. SEO needs time to work.
- **"7-14 days"** - Marketing campaign results start showing
    I prefer to stick with the 'Within 30 days' claim.

### Progressive Timeline Claims
- **Week 1**: Initial uptick, more bookings
    Change this to more traffic to your website and more phone calls.
- **Week 2**: Busier nights, noticeable impact
    You won't see this for 4-6 weeks
- **Week 4**: 60-70% capacity on previously dead nights
    I don't feel comfortable with such a significant claim, ease it off, I want to be realistic.
- **Week 6-8**: Significant changes
    Too vague and non-descript. Also don't over-promise and leave me to under-deliver.
- **6 months**: Full transformation
    Fair to claim this after 6 months.

### Specific Service Timelines
- Menu delivery: 3-5 business days
    Agreed
- Website live: 1-2 weeks
    Agreed
- First event: 10 days to 3 weeks
    Agreed
- Full implementation: 4 weeks
    Agreed

## 3. Performance Metrics & Percentages

### Revenue/Sales Increases
- **15-40% revenue increase** (various contexts)
    Far too high to promise, we could expect to impact up to 5% for basic AI implementation but could be more for a broader business review and fundamental changes.
- **25-40% increase in covers** within 30 days
    Within 90 days
- **200% increase in midweek revenue** within 30 days
    No way, far too high, we could get a 10% increase on mid-week traffic.
- **45% increase in advance bookings** within 6 weeks
    10% increase maximum for a promise
- **68% increase in Tuesday regulars** within 8 weeks
    No way, we wouldn't be able to promise more than 20%

### Efficiency Improvements
- **71% food GP** (improved from 58%)
    Our food gp should never be mentioned explicitly. Just not a % increase (e.g.: we increased our food GP% by 20% by making changes)
- **90% reduction in food waste**  
    Absolutely
- **£250/week waste reduction** on Sunday lunches
    Abslolutely
- **20-30% reduction in overall waste**
    Agreed

### Marketing Performance
- **60,000-70,000 social media views** monthly
    Yes, that's true but it's taken us a long time and consistency to achieve that.
- **79% more engagement** from location-tagged posts
    Absolutely
- **300% more engagement** from live videos
    Absolutel true
- **23% more foot traffic** for pubs with active social media
    Reduce it to 20%

## 4. Specific Numbers & Figures

### Customer/Attendance Numbers
- **300 opted-in contacts** (email database)
    We have 250 opted-in contacts (SMS contacts, not emails)
- **25-35 quiz night attendees** (up from 20)
    When we worked with QuestionOne we ended up with nights where nobody would turn up, we now have a strong 25-30 regulars that come to Quiz Nights month-over-month.
- **60+ Wednesday covers** (up from 20)
    No, we are a wet-led pub so we don't measure covers but we do measure revenue and ATV. We increased our weekday performance by 20% when we implemented first changes.
- **85 people** for Tuesday quiz (in 6 weeks)
    See my note above, do not over-state claims.

### Financial Claims
- **£75 per hour plus VAT** (all services)
    Correct
- **£75,000-£100,000** value added to business
    Correct, that's my estimate for the value AI has added to our business since we started.
- **£400+ weekly** Sunday roast sales increase
    No, our sunday lunch sales are low, but also we have zero waste. We are working with AI right now to drive them up.
- **£250/week** waste savings
    True
- **£2,000/month** identified cost savings
    More than than, we've saved probably £4000 on vendor reviews and switching, energy reduction, rota optimisation, etc. since we stated.
- **£4.50** menu spend increase per customer
    Fair but not reflective because we're wet-led.

### Potential Loss Prevention
- **£30-50** lost revenue per empty chair
    That's high, we're wet led so it would be lower than that but it'll depend on the context.
- **£15,000+ per month** lost from empty pub
    A big claim, I need more context
- **£180,000 a year** potential lost revenue
    I would say around £100k insted.

## 5. Guarantees & Promises

### Core Guarantees
- **30-day action plan with weekly support**
- **"Results in 14 Days or your money back"**
    Results in 30 days depending on what we're working on and also how quickly you can turn around the changes necessary.
- **"Save time or make more money within 30 days"**
    Fair.

### Service Promises
- Reply within 4 hours
    already answered
- No agency fees
    We aren't an agency, so no fees is a fair claim
- Risk-free trial
    Absolutely
- From one licensee to another
    True

## 6. Content Storage Status

### In Sanity CMS
- Social proof metrics
- Trust badges
- Case studies with results
- Homepage content
- Company constants
    I need more information about what this means.

### Still Hardcoded
- Component fallback data
    I don't want fallback data, I want a solid build.
- Page-specific claims
- ROI calculator logic
- Various service page claims

## Recommendations for Review

1. **Consistency Check**: Ensure all time-saving claims align (5 hours vs 25 hours)
2. **Timeline Verification**: Confirm all "within X days" claims are achievable
3. **Metric Validation**: Verify all percentage increases and financial figures
4. **Sanity Migration**: Move remaining hardcoded claims to CMS for easier updates
5. **Documentation Update**: Keep CLAUDE.md synchronized with any changes

## Next Steps

Please review each category and provide guidance on:
- Which claims need updating
- Which claims should be removed
- Any new claims to add
- Priority order for updates

In addition to the claims you have made, I want to make it clear that Billy runs The Anchor day-to-day, not me. I take care of our marketing and business development in my spare time only. He's the hero and I want to make sure people understand our partnership and how strong it is.

This audit is current as of August 2025 and should be updated whenever claims are modified.
