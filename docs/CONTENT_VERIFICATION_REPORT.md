Date: 2025-08-23

## Executive Summary
Systematic comparison of production website content against local codebase reveals several discrepancies that need correction. This report details all findings and required fixes.

## âœ… Pages Already Fixed
1. **Homepage** - Subtitle discrepancy fixed (removed AI reference)

## ðŸ”´ Critical Discrepancies Found

### 1. ABOUT PAGE

#### Production Content:
- **Subtitle**: "We run The Anchor in Stanwell Moor. We discovered how AI saves 25 hours a week. Now we help other licensees do the same."
- **Timeline mentions**: Shows September 2025 as first external client
- **Quick Facts**: Includes specific pricing and guarantee info

#### Local Content (about.json):
- **Subtitle**: "Helping pub owners transform their business with practical AI solutions."
- **Timeline**: Shows September 2025 but labeled as "First pub chain training scheduled"
- Missing some of the conversational elements from production

**ACTIONS REQUIRED**:
- Update about.json subtitle to match production
- Verify timeline entry wording

### 2. SERVICES PAGE

#### Production Content:
- **Title**: "From Empty Tables to Full Tills"
- **Subtitle**: "Every service below has been tested at The Anchor. If it didn't work for us, it's not here."
- **Pricing**: Clear "All services Â£75/hour â€¢ No packages â€¢ Pay for what you need"
- Services show specific problems as questions

#### Local Content (services.json):
- **Title**: "Pub Marketing Services That Fill Empty Tables"
- **Subtitle**: "Transform your struggling pub into a thriving community hub with AI-powered marketing strategies. No corporate nonsense - just proven tactics from one licensee to another."
- Services structured differently with longer descriptions

**ACTIONS REQUIRED**:
- Update hero section to match production
- Simplify service descriptions to match production format

### 3. RESULTS PAGE

#### Production vs Local:
- Content structure appears aligned
- Metrics match: 71% food GP, 25-35 quiz regulars, Â£250 weekly savings, 70k monthly views
- âœ… No critical discrepancies found

### 4. CONTACT PAGE

#### Production Content:
- **Title**: "Talk to Someone Who Gets It"
- **Subtitle**: "I'm Peter. I run a pub. I've been where you are - let's fix your empty tables together."
- Shows personal, direct messaging

#### Local Content:

### 5. SPECIALIZED PAGES (Pub Rescue, Compete with Chains, Quiet Midweek)

#### Critical Issue:
All three specialized pages in local code show **static fallback content** with empty arrays for key content:
```typescript
const emergencyCategories: any[] = [];
const strategies: any[] = [];
const faqs: any[] = [];
```

#### Production shows rich content:
- **Pub Rescue**: Full emergency categories, crisis handling content
- **Compete with Chains**: David vs Goliath positioning, 30-day action plan
- **Quiet Midweek**: Specific Tuesday/Wednesday solutions with financial impact

**ACTIONS REQUIRED**:
- These pages need proper content data files created
- Currently showing minimal static content vs rich production content
