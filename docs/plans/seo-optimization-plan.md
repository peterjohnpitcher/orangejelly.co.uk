**Meta Description**: "Empty tables killing your pub? Get proven marketing strategies that fill seats. Real results from a real licensee. No agency fees. 30-day trial."

### 2. Service Pages Transformation

#### Quick Wins Package → "Empty Pub Solutions"
**URL**: `/empty-pub-solutions`
**H1**: "Your Pub is Empty. Here's How to Fill It in 30 Days"
**Content Focus**: 
- Target: "why is my pub empty"
- Target: "how to get more customers in my pub"

- Target: "how to promote pub on instagram"

### 3. Problem-First Content Architecture

**New Landing Pages Needed:**

   - Target: "pub empty weeknights"
   - H1: "Tuesday Night Dead? Here's How Other Pubs Fixed It"
   - Content: Specific strategies, not generic advice

2. **"Compete with Pub Chains"** (`/compete-with-wetherspoons`)
   - Target: "how to compete with wetherspoons"
   - H1: "Beat the Big Chains: Marketing for Independent Pubs"
   - Content: David vs Goliath positioning

   - Target: "free pub marketing ideas"
   - H1: "£0 Marketing Budget? These Strategies Still Work"
   - Content: Actionable free tactics

### 4. Language Transformation Throughout Site

**REMOVE vague promises:**
- "Save 5 hours a week"
- "AI-powered solutions"
- "Get your evenings back"

**ADD specific solutions:**
- "Fill empty tables on quiet nights"
- "Get found on Google when people search 'pubs near me'"
- "Turn your slow Tuesday into your busiest night"
- "Compete with the chains without their budget"

### 5. Search-Driven FAQ Schema

```json
{
  "@type": "FAQPage",
  "mainEntity": [
    {
      "name": "How do I get more customers in my pub?",
      "acceptedAnswer": "Focus on three things: 1) Local social media with real photos of your food, 2) Google My Business optimization for 'pubs near me' searches, 3) Midweek promotions that give people a reason to visit."
    },
    {
      "name": "Why is my pub empty during the week?",
      "acceptedAnswer": "Weeknight struggles are common. Successful pubs create specific reasons to visit: quiz nights, steak night deals, or 'locals only' promotions. The key is consistency - same offer, same night, every week."
    },
    {
      "name": "How can I compete with Wetherspoons?",
      "acceptedAnswer": "You can't beat them on price, so don't try. Focus on what chains can't offer: personal service, local character, flexibility. Market these differences on social media with real stories from real customers."
    }
  ]
}
```

### 6. Results Page Rewrite

**Current**: "See How We've Helped Other Pubs Thrive"
**New**: "Pubs That Were Empty. Now They're Not. Here's How"

Each case study should lead with the problem:
- "The Anchor's Tuesday Problem" (not "The Anchor Success Story")
- "How This Pub Survived Wetherspoons Opening Next Door"
- "From 5 Covers to 50: The White Hart's Turnaround"

### 7. Blog Strategy - Answer Real Questions

**Monthly Content Calendar:**
1. "Pub Quiz Night Not Working? Here's Why"
2. "Should Pubs Use TikTok? (Real Examples)"
3. "Wetherspoons Opened Nearby: Now What?"
4. "Your Pub Food Photos Look Terrible. Here's How to Fix Them"
5. "Monday Night Dead? 5 Promotions That Actually Work"

### 8. Internal Linking Strategy

Create topic clusters around core problems:
- Empty pub cluster → quiet nights, weekday promotions, increase footfall
- Competition cluster → chains, Wetherspoons, differentiation
- Budget cluster → free marketing, DIY promotion, organic social
- Time cluster → automation, scheduling, delegation

### 9. Meta Descriptions That Convert

Every meta description should:
1. Name the problem
2. Promise a solution
3. Mention it's from a real licensee
4. Include a clear action

Example: "Pub empty on weeknights? Real strategies that filled our tables (we run The Anchor). No agencies, no fluff. See what actually works →"

### 10. URL Structure

All URLs should be problem or solution-focused:
- ❌ `/services` → ✅ `/pub-marketing-solutions`
- ❌ `/about` → ✅ `/licensee-helping-licensees`
- ❌ `/contact` → ✅ `/get-pub-marketing-help`
