## Implementation Notes

### Remove These Claims
- "2 hours earlier home every night" (pub's still busy)
- "85 people for Tuesday quiz" (overstated)
- "£400+ weekly Sunday roast increase" (not accurate - working on growth)
- Any specific food GP percentages (use percentage increases only)
- "Results in 14 days" (replace with 30 days)

### Add These Clarifications
- Billy and Peter's partnership dynamics
- Wet-led pub context for metrics
- Time and consistency required for social media success
- Dependency on implementation speed for results

### Sanity Migration Strategy
1. Create new "Claims" content type in Sanity
2. Organize by category (time, timeline, metrics, guarantees)
3. Add context fields for each claim
4. Remove all hardcoded fallback data
5. Implement proper error states instead of fallbacks

## Error Handling Philosophy
"I'd rather be honest about an error than show bad data" - Show loading states or error messages rather than potentially outdated fallback content.
