## Technical Details

### Sanity Document Structure
```typescript
{
  _type: 'aboutContent',
  _id: 'about-main',
  title: 'About Orange Jelly',
  heroSection: {
    title: string,
    subtitle: string
  },
  story: PortableTextBlock[],
  timeline: TimelineEvent[],
  values: Value[],
  founderSection: {
    name: string,
    role: string,
    bio: PortableTextBlock[],
    image?: ImageAsset,
    quote?: string
  },
  quickFacts: {
    title: string,
    facts: string[]
  },
  visitCTA: {
    title: string,
    subtitle: string,
    locationName: string,
    address: string,
    mapUrl: string,
    ctaText: string
  },
  whyOrangeJelly?: {
    title: string,
    content: PortableTextBlock[]
  },
  partnerships?: Partnership[]
}
```

### FAQ Structure
```typescript
{
  _type: 'faq',
  _id: string,
  question: string,
  answer: PortableTextBlock[],
  page: 'about',
  category: string,

}
```

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Content Management**: All About page content now managed through Sanity CMS
2. **Consistency**: Unified content structure with proper typing
3. **Maintainability**: Non-technical users can update content without code changes  
4. **Performance**: Proper CDN caching and optimized queries
5. **Flexibility**: Easy to add new content sections or modify existing ones
6. **Data Integrity**: No hardcoded fallbacks, clean separation of concerns

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise, you can temporarily restore hardcoded content by reverting the `AboutPage.tsx` file to its previous version with fallback content. However, the current implementation includes proper error handling that should gracefully handle any missing Sanity content.

## Future Enhancements

1. **Image Optimization**: Add responsive images for partnerships and founder
2. **Rich Text Features**: Utilize more advanced Portable Text features
3. **Content Versioning**: Use Sanity's version history for content management
4. **Localization**: Prepare structure for multi-language support if needed
5. **Analytics**: Add tracking for content engagement
