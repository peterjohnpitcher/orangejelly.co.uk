    // Empty Pub Recovery FAQs
    {
      question: "How does the Empty Pub Recovery Package work?",
      answer: "We work with you to implement AI-powered marketing strategies that have been proven at The Anchor. This includes training on social media automation, event promotion, and customer engagement. We charge ¬£62.50 per hour plus VAT, and offer a 30-day money-back guarantee."
    },
    {
      question: "How does your hourly consulting work?",
      answer: "We charge ¬£62.50 per hour plus VAT as a flat rate. I'll work with you to implement the AI strategies that have transformed The Anchor - from social media automation to event planning. First training session with a pub chain scheduled September 2025."
    },
    {
      question: "How quickly will I see more customers from the recovery package?",
      answer: "Results vary by pub, but at The Anchor we've seen quiz nights grow from 20 to 25-35 regulars, tasting nights with 85% retention, and 60,000-70,000 social media views monthly. Most improvements show within 30 days."
    },
    // Menu Makeover FAQs
    {
      question: "How can menu descriptions increase my food sales?",
      answer: "Psychology-based menu descriptions guide customers to order more profitable dishes and increase average spend by ¬£7 per table. We use proven techniques like sensory language, storytelling, and strategic positioning that have increased food GP by up to 15% for our clients."
    },
    {
      question: "What exactly do you do with menu AI?",
      answer: "I'll teach you to use AI for menu analysis, pricing optimization, and seasonal updates. I've helped improve food GP from 58% to 71%, saving ¬£250/week on waste."
    },
    {
      question: "Will AI-written menus sound fake or robotic?",
      answer: "Not at all! I guide the AI to write in your pub's authentic voice. The descriptions feel personal and appetizing - customers often comment on how good our food sounds before they've even tasted it."
    },
    // Quiz Night FAQs
    {
      question: "How do you promote a pub quiz effectively?",
      answer: "Through AI-powered social media campaigns, automated reminders, and community engagement. Our quiz attendance has grown from 20 to 25-35 regulars using these exact methods - I'll show you how to replicate this success."
    },
    {
      question: "What's the secret to quiz night success?",
      answer: "AI automation for consistent promotion, WhatsApp groups for regular attendees, and prize structures that encourage teams. We've grown from 20 to 25-35 regulars with these methods."
    },
    {
      question: "Can AI really help with quiz nights?",
      answer: "Absolutely! AI helps create engaging promotional content, manage bookings, send reminders, and even generate fresh quiz questions. It's transformed our Tuesday nights from empty to buzzing."
    },
    // Social Media FAQs
    {
      question: "Can AI really manage my pub's social media?",
      answer: "Yes - I post 5 times weekly reaching 60,000-70,000 views monthly, spending just 2 hours per week. I'll train you on the exact AI tools and prompts I use, so you can achieve similar results without the time drain."
    },
    {
      question: "Will my social media posts look automated?",
      answer: "Not at all! I'll teach you to guide AI to create posts that sound like you, showcase your pub's personality, and engage your local community. Our posts get more engagement now than when we spent hours writing them manually."
    },
    {
      question: "What if I'm not tech-savvy?",
      answer: "Perfect - neither was I! If you can send a WhatsApp message, you can use these AI tools. I provide step-by-step training designed for busy licensees, not tech experts. Most clients are posting confidently within days."
    },
    // Business Analysis FAQs
    {
      question: "What kind of business insights can AI provide?",
      answer: "AI helps analyze your sales patterns, identify your most profitable customers, optimize staff scheduling, and predict busy periods. I've discovered profit opportunities worth ¬£75,000-¬£100,000 annually using these tools."
    },
    {
      question: "How detailed are your AI business reports?",
      answer: "Very detailed but easy to understand. You'll get insights on customer behavior, menu performance, event ROI, and seasonal trends - all presented in plain English with clear action steps."
    },
    {
      question: "Can AI help with supplier negotiations?",
      answer: "Yes! AI analyzes your purchasing patterns, compares supplier prices, and identifies savings opportunities. I've saved ¬£250/week on food waste alone by optimizing our ordering based on AI predictions."
    },
    // Event Planning FAQs
    {
      question: "How do you create pub events that actually work?",
      answer: "By using AI to analyze what your community wants, automate promotion, and track results. Our tasting nights achieve 85% customer retention because we use data to plan events people actually want to attend."
    },
    {
      question: "What makes your event planning different?",
      answer: "Real experience combined with AI efficiency. I've run successful quiz nights, tasting events, and seasonal promotions. I'll share what works and train you to use AI for promotion and management."
    },
    {
      question: "Can AI predict which events will be successful?",
      answer: "Yes! By analyzing local demographics, past event performance, and social media engagement, AI helps predict which events will draw crowds. It's helped us avoid costly flops and double down on winners."
    },
    // General FAQs
    {
      question: "Why don't you offer fixed-price packages?",
      answer: "Every pub is unique. Fixed packages force you to pay for things you don't need. At ¬£62.50 per hour plus VAT, you only pay for the help you actually use. Most pubs see significant improvements within 20-30 hours of consulting."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I see examples of your work?",
      answer: "Visit The Anchor! See our menus, watch our social media in action, attend a quiz night. Everything I teach, we use daily. First pint's on me - seeing is believing."
    },
    {
      question: "Do you offer remote support?",
      answer: "Yes! Most AI training works perfectly over video calls. I support pubs across the UK with screen sharing, recorded tutorials, and WhatsApp support. Distance is no barrier to getting help."
