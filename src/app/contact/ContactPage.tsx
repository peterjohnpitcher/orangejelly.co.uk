  {
    question: "I'm losing money every day - how quickly can you help?",
    answer: "I understand the urgency - every day matters when you're bleeding money. WhatsApp me right now and I'll respond within hours (or after service if I'm behind the bar). We can often implement quick wins within days that start stemming losses immediately. Our Empty Pub Recovery Package shows results within 7-14 days."
  },
  {
    question: "My pub is in crisis - can we talk today?",
    answer: "Absolutely. WhatsApp me at 07941 266538 - I check messages constantly. If you need immediate help, mark your message as URGENT and I'll prioritise it. I've been where you are, and I know that feeling of desperation. Let's talk solutions today."
  },
  {
    question: "I messaged but haven't heard back - did you get it?",
    answer: "I personally read every message! If I haven't replied within 4 hours, I'm likely in service. I always respond by end of day. If it's been longer, please message again - technology sometimes fails. Never worry about 'bothering' me - helping pubs is what I do."
  },
  {
    question: "What's the best way to contact Orange Jelly for urgent help?",
    answer: "WhatsApp is fastest - 07941 266538. I see messages immediately even during service. For urgent situations, start your message with URGENT. Phone calls work too, but if I'm serving, WhatsApp ensures I see your message and can respond as soon as I'm free."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I speak to someone who actually understands pub problems?",
    answer: "That's exactly what you get! I'm Peter, I run The Anchor pub. When you message, you're talking to someone who's dealt with staff walking out mid-shift, empty Tuesday nights, and supplier nightmares. No call centre, no junior staff - just one licensee helping another."
  },
  {
    question: "I work crazy hours - when can I actually reach you?",
    answer: "That's pub life! Message me anytime - 3am stocktake, 6am delivery, Sunday afternoon crisis. I get it. WhatsApp me whenever suits you. I might be serving too, but I always respond within hours. We'll find a time to talk properly that works for both of us."
  },
  {
    question: "I hate pushy sales calls - will you pressure me?",
    answer: "Never. I'm a licensee, not a salesperson. When we chat, I'll listen to your problems and share what worked for us. If I can help, great. If not, I might know someone who can. No scripts, no pressure - just honest conversation about saving your pub."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I visit before committing to anything?",
    answer: "Please do! Come to The Anchor and see everything in action. Watch how we use the tools, chat with Billy, see our results firsthand. First pint's on me. Seeing is believing - I'd rather show you than tell you. We're in Stanwell Moor, TW19 6AQ."
  },
  {
    question: "What if I need help outside normal hours?",
    answer: "'Normal hours' don't exist in hospitality! Message me whenever you need help. Having a 3am panic about tomorrow's event? Send that message. Sunday staff crisis? I'm here. I run a pub too - I know problems don't wait for business hours."
  },
  {
    question: "I'm not in your area - can you still help?",
    answer: "Absolutely! We help pubs across the UK. Marketing, menu design, business analysis, and AI training all work remotely. We use video calls, screen sharing, and good old phone calls. Distance isn't a barrier - I'm helping pubs from Cornwall to Scotland."
  },
  {
    question: "What if I just need 10 minutes of advice?",
    answer: "That's fine! Quick questions are welcome. Sometimes 10 minutes of good advice can save hours of stress. Message me your question - if it's genuinely quick, I'll help right away. If it needs more time, we'll arrange a proper chat."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I know you'll actually respond?",
    answer: "Because I'm not a big company - I'm one person who genuinely cares about helping pubs survive. Every message comes directly to my phone. I've been ghosted by suppliers and consultants too - I won't do that to you. You'll always get a response, even if it's just to say I'm in service and will call back later."
