# Sanity Studio GROQ Mutations

## Step 1: Delete all existing case studies

Run this in Sanity Studio Vision or API Playground:

```groq
*[_type == "caseStudy"]
```

Then delete each one manually in the Studio, or use this mutation in the API playground:

```json
{
  "mutations": [
    {
      "delete": {
        "query": "*[_type == 'caseStudy']"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Step 2: Import new case studies

Use the Sanity Studio to create new documents with the data from case-studies-for-sanity.md

Alternatively, you can use the Sanity CLI:

1. First, export the case studies to a NDJSON file
2. Then import them using: `sanity dataset import case-studies.ndjson production`
