    {
      question: "What events actually work for midweek?",
      answer: "Quiz nights (done right) can pull 60-100 people. Steak nights, curry clubs, and wine tastings work brilliantly. The key is consistency, proper promotion, and making it unmissable. We'll show you exactly how.",
      category: 'service'
    },
    {
      question: "How much revenue am I losing on quiet nights?",
      answer: "A pub doing 20 covers on a Tuesday instead of 60 loses ¬£1,200 that night. Over a month, that's ¬£4,800. Over a year? ¬£57,600 in lost revenue just from Tuesday nights alone.",

      question: "How quickly will I see midweek improvements?",
