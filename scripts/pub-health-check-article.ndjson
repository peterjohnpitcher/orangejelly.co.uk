Weekly monitoring of critical areas like cellar temperature and line cleaning is essential. Set aside time each Monday to review the previous week's performance.","isVoiceOptimized":true},{"_key":"faq_2","question":"What's the single most important metric to track?","answer":"Gross Profit Percentage (GP%) is your most critical metric. If GP% falls below 45%, you're in danger. This single number tells you whether you're making money on what you sell. Track it weekly and investigate any drops immediately.","isVoiceOptimized":true},{"_key":"faq_3","question":"How much can poor cellar management really cost?","answer":"Poor cellar management can cost £14,000-£27,000 annually for a typical 10-tap pub. Most pubs lose 12% of beer through poor practices, but reducing this to 5% saves thousands. That's pure profit going straight to your bottom line.","isVoiceOptimized":true},{"_key":"faq_4","question":"What's the best wet/dry sales ratio?","answer":"There's no universal 'best' ratio - it depends on your location and customer base. Community wet-led pubs typically run 90:10, while food-focused venues might be 60:40. The key is knowing your ratio and optimising your offer accordingly.","isVoiceOptimized":false},{"_key":"faq_5","question":"How do I know if my prices are right?","answer":"Right pricing balances competitiveness with profitability. Survey local competition, calculate your costs accurately, and ensure you're achieving target GP%. If customers complain about price but still buy, you're probably about right. If they stop coming, you've gone too far.","isVoiceOptimized":false}],"localSEO":{"targetLocation":"United Kingdom","nearbyLandmarks":["Local high street","Town centre","Village pub"],"localModifiers":["near me","local pub","in my area","nearby"]},"seo":{"metaTitle":"Pub Health Check: Essential Business Fundamentals Guide 2024","metaDescription":"Complete guide to pub business health checks.
